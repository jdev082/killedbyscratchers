Various services apart of the unofficial "Scratch ecosystem" that were discontinued/ shut down
# Aviate (April 6th, 2022 to March 23rd 2024)
## What was it?
A service that allowed for dynamic [Forum](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss) statuses that consisted of various keywords that allowed for a status to contain data/information grabbed from an API, calculated by the server, etc. 
## Why was it shut down?
Shut down due to the difficulties and inconveniences of hosting, the various issues occuring with [ScratchDB](https://scratchdb.lefty.one), as well as a proposed merge with [Ocular](https://ocular.jeffalo.net) that didn't quite go to plan. 
## Additional Information
Aviate is a little over 2 years old. [Announcement](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/post/7878515/)
