# killedbyscratchers
Various services apart of the unofficial "Scratch ecosystem" that were discontinued/ shut down
# Aviate (April 6th, 2022 to March 23rd 2024)
## What was it?
A service that allowed for dynamic [Forum](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss) statuses that consisted of various keywords that allowed for a status to contain data/information grabbed from an API, calculated by the server, etc. 
## Why was it shut down?
Shut down due to the difficulties and inconveniences of hosting, the various issues occuring with [ScratchDB](https://scratchdb.lefty.one), as well as a proposed merge with [Ocular](https://ocular.jeffalo.net) that didn't quite go to plan. 
## Additional Information
Aviate is a little over 2 years old. [Announcement](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/post/7878515/)
# ScratchConnect (June 19th, 2021 to October 16th, 2023)
## What was it?
ScratchConnect was a library that allowed for programatic interaction with Scratch and the various services in it's "ecosystem". It could interact with services such as [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org), [Aviate]([https://github.com/jdev082/killedbyscratchers/edit/main/README.md](https://github.com/jdev082/killedbyscratchers#Aviate), etc.
## Why was it shut down?
It isn't made clear why this library was discontinued, however it seems like the developer no longer wished to maintain it.
